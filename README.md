# Vaadin Template Application

This repository contains a general web app template using Vaadin and Spring Boot.

It has very basic (not production safe) Spring Security login and default styling, which can be overridden in the `styles.css`. 

Most of the code is referenced from the [Vaadin docs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest).

To run the app, simply run `mvn clean install` and then `mvn spring-boot:run`. The app runs at `localhost:8080`.
